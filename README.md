# Opencv tutorial demo project

**Opencv demo** is a quick opencv tutorial to demostrate what we can do with opencv library!

Submitted by: **Xiaohu Zheng**

Time spent: About **10** days spent in total

## functionalities
The following functionalities are demostrated:

- how to convert the image color space to GRAY/HSV scale by using cvtColor
- how to create image with Mat() constructor
- how to visit the image's position by using pointer and index
- how to do arithmetics between images
- how to create track bars
- how to implements keyboard response functionality
- how to apply opencv colormap to an image
- how to do bitwise operation between images
- how to split and merge images
- combine inrange() and cvtColor() to change the image background
- how to get the statistic of an image
- how to draw geometric figure with opencv (demostrated with random position and color)
- how to create mouse event
- how to normalize an image
- how to resize an image. (combined with mouse event, so that we can use the mouse wheel to change the image size)
- how to flip and rotate an image
- how to load and save video
- how to calculate histogram (both 1D and 2D)
- how to equalize single channel image and RBG image
- how to blur an image
- how to detect faces

## Notes
If you want to test any of these demostration functions, simply uncomment the corresponding function call in the main file.
